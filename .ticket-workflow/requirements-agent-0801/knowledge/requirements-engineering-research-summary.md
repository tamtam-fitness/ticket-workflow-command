2025-08-01

## Overview
Comprehensive research conducted on requirements engineering best practices, classification systems, stakeholder elicitation techniques, analysis phases, and review checklists to inform the development of a specialized Requirements Definition Agent.

## üèóÔ∏è Requirements Classification Systems (2024-2025)

### Primary Classification Framework
Based on BABOK Guide and modern software engineering practices:

1. **Business Requirements**
   - High-level project essentials describing company's business objectives
   - Journey of the project and organizational goals
   - Success criteria and strategic alignment

2. **User/Stakeholder Requirements** 
   - Value expectations from individual user groups (customers, managers, etc.)
   - Stakeholder-specific needs and constraints
   - User experience and interaction requirements

3. **Functional Requirements**
   - What the system must do (features and functionalities)
   - System behavior and operations
   - Input/output specifications

4. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
   - How the system should perform
   - 15 main categories according to BABOK (2024):
     - Performance and Scalability
     - Security
     - Reliability and Availability
     - Usability
     - Maintainability
     - Portability
     - Compatibility
     - Capacity
     - Interoperability
     - Regulatory/Compliance
     - Environmental
     - Supportability
     - Testability
     - Configurability
     - Installation requirements

### Key Statistics from Research
- **60-80% of software development costs** involve rework due to poor requirements
- **50-80% of product defects** can be eliminated with proper non-functional requirements
- **Deep learning frameworks** are emerging for automated NFR classification (2024 research)

## üë• Stakeholder Requirements Elicitation Techniques

### Primary Elicitation Methods (2024 Research)

1. **Interviews**
   - **Structured**: Predefined questions and format
   - **Semi-structured**: Flexible format with core questions
   - **Unstructured**: Open-ended exploratory discussions
   - **Best for**: One-to-one detailed requirement gathering

2. **Surveys and Questionnaires**  
   - **Quantitative data collection** for large stakeholder groups
   - **Percentage-based insights** (e.g., % of stakeholders wanting specific features)
   - **Best for**: Wide reach and statistical insights

3. **Observation Techniques**
   - **Active observation**: Asking questions during work observation
   - **Passive observation**: Silent observation of activities and workflows
   - **Best for**: Understanding actual vs. stated workflows

4. **Focus Groups and Workshops**
   - **Collaborative requirement identification**
   - **Common themes and priorities** identification
   - **Best for**: Consensus building and conflict resolution

5. **Brainstorming Sessions**
   - **Creative solution generation** for specific issues
   - **Domain experts and subject matter experts** participation
   - **Best for**: Innovation and alternative approaches

6. **Use Cases and Scenarios**
   - **Behavior-driven requirement definition**
   - **User journey mapping**
   - **Best for**: Functional requirement clarity

7. **Prototyping**
   - **Early validation** of concepts and requirements
   - **Visual and interactive feedback**
   - **Best for**: User interface and experience requirements

8. **Role-playing**
   - **Stakeholder perspective understanding**
   - **Process simulation**
   - **Best for**: Complex business process requirements

### 2024 Innovation: Recommendation Systems
- **AI-driven requirement prediction** based on stakeholder preferences
- **Machine learning analysis** of functional and non-functional requirement patterns
- **Automated stakeholder need prediction** based on historical data

   - Requirement confirmation and validation

3. **Requirements Life Cycle Management**
   - Requirement tracing
   - Requirement maintenance
   - Requirement prioritization
   - Change assessment
   - Requirement approval

4. **Strategy Analysis**
   - Business need analysis
   - Current state analysis
   - Future state definition
   - Transition strategy planning

5. **Requirements Analysis and Design Definition**
   - Requirement specification
   - Requirement modeling
   - Design definition
   - Solution validation

6. **Solution Evaluation**
   - Solution performance measurement
   - Recommendation formulation
   - Change assessment

### Requirements Life Cycle Management Tasks
- **Trace Requirements**: Establish relationships and dependencies
- **Maintain Requirements**: Keep requirements current and accurate
- **Prioritize Requirements**: Establish importance and sequence
- **Assess Requirements Changes**: Impact analysis of modifications
- **Approve Requirements**: Formal stakeholder sign-off process

## ‚úÖ Requirements Review Checklists (2024-2025)
